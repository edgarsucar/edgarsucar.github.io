I am a PhD student in the Dyson Robotics Lab at Imperial College London, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/">Prof. Andrew Davison</a>. I am generally interested in developing methods for 3D scene understanding that enable machines to have meaningful interactions with their environment. I like building practical real-time systems which work in the real world.

<strong>Research Interests:</strong> Computer Vision, SLAM, Neural Scene Representations, Unsupervised/continual Learning, Robotics
